    <p>As a scientific endeavour, machine learning grew out of the quest for <b><i>artificial intelligence (AI)</i></b>. In the early days of AI as an academic discipline, some researchers were interested in having machines learn from data. They attempted to approach the problem with various symbolic methods, as well as what were then termed "neural networks"; these were mostly perceptrons and other models that were later found to be reinventions of the generalised linear models of statistics.<sup>[20]</sup> Probabilistic reasoning was also employed, especially in automated medical diagnosis.<sup>[21]: 488</sup></p><br>
    <p>However, an increasing emphasis on the logical, knowledge-based approach caused a rift between AI and machine learning. Probabilistic systems were plagued by theoretical and practical problems of data acquisition and representation.<sup>[21]: 488</sup>  By 1980, expert systems had come to dominate AI, and statistics was out of favour.<sup>[22]</sup> Work on symbolic/knowledge-based learning did continue within AI, leading to inductive logic programming(ILP), but the more statistical line of research was now outside the field of AI proper, in pattern recognition and information retrieval.<sup>[21]: 708–710, 755 </sup> Neural networks research had been abandoned by AI and computer science around the same time. This line, too, was continued outside the AI/CS field, as "connectionism", by researchers from other disciplines including John Hopfield, David Rumelhart, and Geoffrey Hinton. Their main success came in the mid-1980s with the reinvention of backpropagation.<sup>[21]: 25 </sup></p><br>
    <p>Machine learning (ML), reorganised and recognised as its own field, started to flourish in the 1990s. The field changed its goal from achieving artificial intelligence to tackling solvable problems of a practical nature. It shifted focus away from the symbolic approaches it had inherited from AI, and toward methods and models borrowed from statistics, fuzzy logic, and probability theory.<sup>[22]</sup></p>
